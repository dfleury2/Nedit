Nedit
=====

A port of [Nedit](http://www.nedit.org) to C++ and FLTK

This a joke project to have fun coding with C++ (at this time
only replacing C by C++), learning FLTK and add some gtests for TDD.

This project contains:
 - all the original NEdit source code
 - Some prototypes for some part I have port to C++/FLTK
 - A Visual Studio 2010 project file
 - A Linux Makefile

This project needs FLTK 1.3. You need to change to prop files to fill the FLTK home.

Basic editing functions are availables (open, save, find).
Copy/paste should work fine, as the rectangular selection.
Syntax highlighting is just *pre-alpha* quality, and crash a lot.
There is no macros, shell commands, adn help.

This editor version is pretty harmfull, very unstable and immature. You use it only for
experimental purpose.
