Nedit
=====

A port of [Nedit](http://www.nedit.org) to C++ and FLTK

This a joke project to have fun coding with C++ (at this time
only replacing C by C++), learning FLTK and add some gtests for TDD.

This project contains:
 - all the original NEdit source code
 - Some prototypes for some part I have port to C++/FLTK
 - A Visual Studio 2010 project file
 - A Linux Makefile

This project needs FLTK 1.3. You need to change to prop files to fill the FLTK home.

Basic editing functions are availables (open, save, find).
Syntax highlighting is just *pre-alpha* quality.

This editor version is pretty harmfull, very unstable and immature. You use it only for
experimental purpose.
